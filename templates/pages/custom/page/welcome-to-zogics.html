                        <p>Our home is our playground. We’re located in the Berkshires — a hotbed of culture surrounded by the great outdoors. You can find us in the foothills of the largest state forest in Massachusetts, where we hike, run, bike, and x-country ski on a daily basis. We believe in wowing our customers and in giving back in ways that help maintain, expand, and preserve our amazing forests and ridgelines.</p>
